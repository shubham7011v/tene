# How to Fix the App Launcher Icon Issue

The app is failing to build because it can't find the launcher icons. Here's how to solve this:

## Option 1: Create Icons Manually (Quick Fix)

1. Visit https://easyappicon.com/ or https://romannurik.github.io/AndroidAssetStudio/icons-launcher.html
2. Upload any image to generate Android launcher icons
3. Download the generated icons 
4. Create these directories in your project:
   ```
   android/app/src/main/res/mipmap-hdpi
   android/app/src/main/res/mipmap-mdpi
   android/app/src/main/res/mipmap-xhdpi
   android/app/src/main/res/mipmap-xxhdpi
   android/app/src/main/res/mipmap-xxxhdpi
   ```
5. Extract the downloaded icons to these folders, making sure they're named `ic_launcher.png`

## Option 2: Use flutter_launcher_icons Plugin

1. Create an icon image (512x512px) and save it to `assets/images/app_icon.png`
2. Run:
   ```
   flutter pub run flutter_launcher_icons
   ```

## After Adding the Icons

Run these commands to clean and rebuild:
```
flutter clean
flutter pub get
```

Try building the app again.
